                <section class="about">
                    <h3>About the Festival</h3>
                    <p>We love film and we love music. Even more than that, we love them together. But the thing that continually floors us is that when you put great picture with great music,
                        the result is not just a sum of the parts.</p>
                    <p>Often as those moments happen, we want to celebrate them. That's the heart behind Boomtown Film and Music Festival. It's about you, 
                        the amazing films you make and the music that bring them to life.</p>
                    <p>What sets us apart since 2007 from the many other film festivals world-wide is our distinctive approach to film programming, 
                        committed celebrity guests and friendly leisurely pace. You will have plenty of time to enjoy the amenities during the festival. 
                        The Festival screenings is held at the Waterfront, and most nights there is live entertainment before the feature film begins in the Waterfront Amphitheater</p>
                    <p>Our spaces and events encourage the open exchange of ideas and perspectives with a freely flowing cimmunication anchored in mutual respect. 
                        Hearty and comprehensive debate is intrinsic to our community values and we encourage all festival goers to converse and debate, and to do so with respect. </p>
                    <p>Therefore, we ask that everyone in the Festival; artists, audiences, volunteers, staff, and beyond — does their part in creating an environment that is welcoming to all.</p>
                    <p>Stay tuned, in the coming weeks the festival will be announcing some exciting developments for this year’s festival.
                        Soon announcements will begin regarding upcoming special guests, Official Selection films, bands and all other special events.</p>
                    <p>So come and have some fun and enjoy all that we have to offer</p>
                    <p>Our sincere thanks to you for all of your support and encouragement each step of the way. That support is often times what has kept us going strong.</p>
